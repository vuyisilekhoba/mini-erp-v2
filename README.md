# Mini ERP V2 – Stock2shop Technical Demo

**Mini ERP V2** is a lightweight, full-stack ERP backend built with **Flask** and **SQLite**, created as a technical demonstration aligned with the **Technical Support Consultant role at Stock2shop**. It showcases backend development, role-based access, and inventory management while emphasizing skills directly relevant to the position.

## Why I Created Mini ERP V2

I built **Mini ERP V2** to simulate a real ERP system environment similar to what Stock2shop clients use. This project allowed me to:

- Explore **database management** and **data mapping**, simulating how products and orders might be structured in an ERP.
- Implement **role-based access and token authentication** to reflect practical access control in B2B software.
- Build **RESTful APIs** and understand **JSON data handling**, which mirrors integration work with client ERP systems.
- Gain hands-on experience with **SQL queries, data modeling, and relational databases**, all critical for supporting client requests and ERP integration.
- Demonstrate proficiency in **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **version control with GitHub** — core tools that reflect the technical capabilities Stock2shop values.

By creating this, I could practically demonstrate the **skills, attention to detail, and technical understanding** required for the Technical Support Consultant role.
